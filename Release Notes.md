# Release Notes LDM 6.4
This document contains both the high-level release notes and - in the
annexes - the details of the of the changes from version 6.3 as
published in January 2024 to version 6.4. This describes the summary of
the changes made to the LDM since its previous release. It is based on
the issues in GitLab that were included in this release.

## Older Release Notes
Older release notes can be found in the [GitLab
repo](https://gitlab.sofa.dev/sdd-bird-team/bird-logical-data-model/-/tree/develop?ref_type=heads).

# Summary of Changes
The past half year, we updated 115 entity types, added 83 new entity
types, of which 7 are derived data entity types, and we removed 16
entity types. Of those many changes in the logical data model (LDM)
the following are the most impactful. These are almost all for FINREP,
with a handful for fine-tuning the fundamental instrument structure by
discussing the full picture of syndicated loans and clarifying how to
deal with assets and liabilities and how these are recorded in the
balance sheet. With this, the data modelling work related to the work
of the subgroup for FINREP is complete.

## Many Updates for the FINREP Alignment
Key highlights of these updates are: Everywhere for FINREP where a
Non-negotiable debt security or any required Debt security information
that is treated like a loan, the requested information is now
available in the LDM. There are many more ways to relate Collateral to
the exposure it is protecting, with more information available. All
Fair value-related attributes are now available too. It is now
possible to indicate which individual collateral has been obtained by
taking possession and how to aggregate them to the various
Non-financial assets. Risk transfer information has been updated with
more information on the type of risk transfer and the recognition
status in the balance sheet. As a side-effect of this, the securities
leg of a repo has been updated to include Equity instruments that are
not a security leg, and Loans and advances leg next to the existing
Security leg. Key management personnel, both of the customer and of
the Reporting agent are now part of the model as well.

## Other updates
The most notable of the other changes are that the constitution of the
Institutional unit is now correctly modelled and that the previous
split of Financial asset instrument into Serviced asset instrument and
Financial asset instrument has been rolled back into Financial asset
instrument.

# Detailed Changes Included in Version 6.4
The changes recorded in Gitlab that are listed below have had a direct
impact on the model. These changes are split into two types. The first
concerns those changes where the structure of the model has been
amended or changed in such a way that when data is reported via the
BIRD LDM, the reported data would change. The second type of changes
are those that updated the model without impacting the structure of
the reported data.

## Updates that do not impact the structure of the logical data model/input layer

- Names of relationship types were updated to include the names of
  the entity types they relate to.
- Names of entity types and attributes where harmonised towards the
  English spelling.
- Small additions and update to various definitions to fix typing mistakes 
  and provide more clarity. 

## Updates that changed the structure of the logical data model/input layer

- Reversed the split of _Financial asset instrument_ into _Serviced
  asset instrument_ by moving the attributes back into _Financial
  asset instrument_ or one of its subtypes. It is clarified that
  _Financial asset instrument_ deals with instruments that can be seen
  as an asset regardless of their balance sheet status.
- The institutional unit that is the reporting agent can now correctly
  relate to local and foreign branches.
- More links between _Collateral_ and _Security_, both where the
  _Security_ is the guarantee, and where the _Collateral_ is given for
  protection of the _Debt security_.
- The aggregates in the _Non-financial asset_ now can link to
  individual underlying _Collateral_, this is especially useful with the 
  new addition showing when the _Collateral_ has been taken into
  possession to mitigate a defaulted exposure.
- Added structures to record Key management personnel. 


## Changes to domain members

- Updates to many members related to FINREP. 


## Changes to the forward engineering

- Only updates to fix bugs and streamline the process.


## Changes to the documentation

- The introduction to the LDM document contains updated pictures and
  an update for forbearance measures, and includes the highlights of
  the new relationship types between _Non-financial assets_ and 
  _Collateral_.


###	Introduction to the BIRD LDM
1. The introductory pictures to each chapter have been updated to
include the new relationship types.  
2. The pictures in this document are updated to include the relevant
LDM changes that are listed above.


# Annex 1:	List of closed GitLab issues
