# Release notes LDM 6.2
High-level release notes of the changes from version 6.1 as
published in December 2022 to version 6.2. This describes the summary
of the changes made to the LDM since its previous release. It is based
on the issues in GitLab that were included in this release.

## Older release notes
Older release notes can be found in the [GitLab
repo](https://gitlab.sofa.dev/sdd-bird-team/bird-logical-data-model/-/tree/develop?ref_type=heads).

# Summary of changes
Of the many changes in the logical data model (LDM) the following are
the most impactful. 

# Changes included in version 6.2
The changes recorded in Gitlab that are listed below have had a direct
impact on the model. These changes are split into two types. The first
concerns those changes where the structure of the model has been
amended or changed in such a way that when data is reported via the
BIRD LDM, the reported data would change. The second type of changes
are those that updated the model without impacting the structure of
the reported data.

## Updates that do not impact the structure of the logical data model/input layer
- Updated the definitions of the various attributes called inception
  date. They now all refer to the entity type where they belong to.
- All arcs denoting mutually exclusive subtypes in the LDM diagram now
  do have the names of their discriminator. This is especially helpful
  when there is multiple subtyping and thus multiple discriminators.
- Updated the definition of the attribute Goverened country code to
  indicate that it means the country that is goverened by the central
  governement.
- Updated the definition of entity type 'Trace receivable' to
  reference the correct part of the relevant regulation.
- Updated the preferred abbreviations of many attributes to be able to
  align them directly to the variables used in the various cubes of
  the reference frameworks that are also present on the [BIRD
  website](https://bird.ecb.europa.eu/). The change noted in the log
  is for all attributes with that abbreviation as they all map to the
  corresponding variable in the reference frameworks.

## Updates that changed the structure of the logical data model/input layer
- Added a singleton subtype for the European Central Bank (ECB) 
- Added a way to indicate if a Collateral received instrument,
  that is a Credit default swaps (CDSs) is eligible to be used as a
  Financial guarantee.
- Added attribute Negotiable security indicator to the ISIN security.
- Added address and postal code structure for EU and Non-EU addresses.
- Harmonised the partner and linked enterprise modelling approaches to
  model them as party roles, or more specifically, as "Central bank
  and private sector company roles".
- Updated the primary key of rating agency - removed the model context
  from the key as the external rating is not dependent on the
  reporting agent.
- Changed the name of entity type "Central bank and private sector
  company other than corporation" to "Private sector company other
  than corporation". And we changed the name of "Corporation" to
  "Central bank and Corporation". This makes it more clear why
  "Central bank" falls under Central bank and corporation.
- The reference data was removed from the input layer.
- Changed all the names of all relevant entity types, attributes,
  foreign keys and relationship types related to asset securitisation
  to use the British English spelling instead of the English spelling
  of the United States of America. We changed Tranch to Tranche and
  Program to Programme.

## Changes to domain members
- Updated the abbreviations used as codes for the members of domains
  to be able to align them direclty to the members used in the various
  domains of the reference frameworks that are also present on the
  [BIRD website](https://bird.ecb.europa.eu/).

## Changes to the forward engineering
- In the BIRD LDM IL excel export file that we provide, there is an
  excel column that tells you for each field in the input layer what
  the corresponding attribute is in the LDM.

## Changes to the documentation
- For ease of creating new issues, we introduced 3 templates that help
  with the creation of issues in GitLab. This is not so much a
  documentation change as an update to the process of capturing
  issues.
